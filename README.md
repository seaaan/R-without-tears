# R without tears 

A course series designed to teach biomedical scientists to use `R` and the `tidyverse` instead of Excel to analyze their everyday data. 

The lessons omit much of what is typical in introductory R courses, such as even base R operations like subsetting with `[]` in favor of `tidyverse` idioms which will be more intuitive to scientists with no programming background. Example datasets include real biomedical data of the sort scientists might generate themselves.    

Course overview: 

* Lesson 1:   introduction, read data, view data
* Lesson 2:   `dplyr`: select, filter
* Lesson 3:   `dplyr`: pipe, summarise/group_by
* Lesson 4:   `dplyr`: mutate 
* Lesson 5:   `ggplot2`: introduction
* Lesson 6:   `ggplot2`: continued
* Lesson 7:   `tidyr`: data shape and tidy data
* Lesson 8:   `dplyr`: joins, combining multiple files
* Lesson 9:   `dplyr/tidyr`: normalizing data (subtracting background, normalizing to control)

The lessons are meant to be presented by an instructor with discussion, either in a lecture or one-on-one setting.
